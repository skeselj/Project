SafeCity is a crime mapping and analytics tool designed to deliver insights about crime in the most clear and convenient way possible. Currently, three cities are supported, New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles, and there are around 500,000 points in the database. This application was a course project for COS333: Advanced Programming Techniques at Princeton University and was completed during the spring semester of 2016.
